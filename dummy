Explanation of the Template:
User Query: The user asks for the nearest branch location using a zip code. In this template, the [zip_code] placeholder is used where the zip code will be dynamically inserted.

Agent Prompt: The agent responds with a JSON object that includes:

A general response to inform the user that the nearest branches are being returned.

A mock api_response with:

status: Always "success" for this mock response.

message: Provides a description of the request being processed.

data: Contains an array of mock branch locations, each with:

branch_name: The name of the branch.

address: The address of the branch.

zip_code: The zip code (the one requested by the user).

distance: The distance of the branch from the provided zip code (mock data).

Example Use Case:
If a user queries with zip code 10001, the agent would respond with the following mock data:
