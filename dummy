# Understanding `SequenceMatcher` with an Example

`SequenceMatcher` is a Python tool from the `difflib` library that compares two sequences (strings, lists, etc.) and identifies their similarity. It focuses on finding the **longest contiguous matching subsequences** and calculates a similarity score.

---

## How `SequenceMatcher` Works

- It identifies **matching blocks**: Parts of the sequences that are the same.
- It calculates a **similarity ratio**: A value between 0 and 1 indicating how similar the sequences are.
- It provides **opcodes**: Instructions to transform one sequence into another.

## Example: Comparing Two Strings

### Strings to Compare
1. `"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"`
2. `"The quick blue fox jumped over a lazy dog"`

---

### Step 1: Using `SequenceMatcher`

```python
from difflib import SequenceMatcher

# Define the strings
string1 = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"
string2 = "The quick blue fox jumped over a lazy dog"

# Initialize SequenceMatcher
matcher = SequenceMatcher(None, string1, string2)

# Calculate similarity ratio
similarity_ratio = matcher.ratio()



### Step 3: Visualizing Matching Blocks

| **String 1**                   | The quick **brown** fox jumps over the lazy dog |
|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **String 2**                   | The quick **blue** fox jumped over a lazy dog   |
| **Matching Parts**             | `"The quick"`, `"fox jumped over"`, `"a lazy dog"` |
| **Non-Matching Parts (Replaced)** | `"brown"` ↔ `"blue"`, `"jumps"` ↔ `"jumped"`     |






# Get matching blocks
matching_blocks = matcher.get_matching_blocks()

# Get opcodes (differences and matches)
opcodes = matcher.get_opcodes()

# Print results
print(f"Similarity Ratio: {similarity_ratio:.2f}")
print("Matching Blocks:", matching_blocks)
print("Opcodes:", opcodes)
